POJECT TITLE:Traffic conjection system
PROBLEM STATMENT:Traffic congestion is a major challenge in urban and semi-urban regions due to increasing vehicle density, unplanned road networks, and unpredictable weather conditions. Commuters often face delays, increased fuel consumption, air pollution, and stress because they lack real-time information about traffic and weather conditions along their routes. Existing navigation systems may not always provide combined insights into congestion levels and weather impact, making route selection inefficient. Hence, there is a need for a simple, web-based system that analyzes real-time traffic congestion and weather conditions to assist users in selecting the most efficient and less congested route
PROPOSED SOLUTION-:To address this problem, an HTML-based Traffic Congestion Analysis and Route Advisory System is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Maps and Weather API integration. The system enables users to select a source, destination, and route type through an interactive interface. It retrieves real-time traffic details such as distance, travel time, and congestion levels, along with weather conditions along the selected route. By analyzing this data, the system suggests efficient routes, reducing delays, fuel wastage, and improving travel efficiency in smart city transportation systems.
FEATURES:
-Real-time traffic congestion analysis,
-Live distance and estimated travel time calculation,
-Weather updates along the selected route,
-Estimated fuel consumption for the chosen route,
-Alerts for road construction and blocked paths,
-Multiple route comparison for optimal selection,
-Interactive source, destination, and route type selection,
-Web-based application with no installation required,
-User-friendly and responsive interface,
-Supports smart city and intelligent transportation systems.
TECH STACK:
Frontend- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
APIs-
Maps API (for routes, traffic, distance, and travel time)
Weather API (for route-based weather information)
Browser-based execution (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
